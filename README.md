## Hello, my name is Karan 👋

I am a researcher interested in leveraging climate data and machine learning tools for sustainable development.

### I am excited about:
- Building pipelines for analyzing geospatial data on climate change 🌎
- Developing methods to create hyperlocal measurements of climate risks and economic impacts 🔍
- Leveraging unstructured text data for fine-grained measures of climate action 📝
- Applying network analysis and topological methods to understand green growth opportunities 🌱
- Implementing deep learning solutions for low-resource settings to support sustainable development in emerging economies 🤖

My projects are primarily in private repositories. If you're interested in collaboration or have any questions, feel free to reach out! 🤝
